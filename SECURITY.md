# Security Considerations

## ⚠️ Warning: Do Not Commit Tokens

**Never commit API tokens, client secrets, or other credentials to version control.**

This includes:
- `SPOT_API_TOKEN`
- `SPOT_CLIENT_ID`
- `SPOT_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Any other authentication credentials

Use environment variables or secure credential management systems instead.

## Production Recommendations

For production deployments:
- Use a secure secret management system (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Implement proper access controls and least-privilege principles
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Enable audit logging for API access

## Future Security Enhancements

This is a placeholder. Later additions may include:
- Input validation details
- Secure coding practices
- Encryption requirements
- Authentication flow documentation
- Security testing procedures
